# Dating Profile
This allows you to set your dating profile and update it either during or after character generation.

`dateprof <name>` - Displays the dating profile of a character.
`dateprof/set <description>` - Sets your dating profile.
`dateprof/clear` - Clears your dating profile.

Admins with the `manage_apps` permission can update other people's profiles:

`dateprof/set <name>=<description>` - Sets a character's dating profile.
`dateprof/clear <name>` - Clears a character's dating profile.
