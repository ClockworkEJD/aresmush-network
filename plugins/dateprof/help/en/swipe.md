# Swiping
These commands allow you to interact with the Dating App.

`swipe` - Display the current profile to swipe.
`swipe <type>` - Swipe on the current profile.
`swipe <name>=<type>` - Swipe on the named character.
`swipe/list <type>` - Display your swipes.
`swipe/matches` - Display your matches and missed connections.

The valid types are: `interested`, `curious`, `skip`, and `missed connection`.

If you and somebody both swipe interested, you will have a `solid` match.
If one of you swipes interested, and the other curious, you will have an `okay` match.
If you and both swipe curious, you will have a `maybe` match.

If you have swiped either `interested` or `curious` on somebody and do not have
a match, but think it would be an interesting connection. You can swipe `missed
connection` to indicate that. You will show up as a `missed connection` match
for that person.
